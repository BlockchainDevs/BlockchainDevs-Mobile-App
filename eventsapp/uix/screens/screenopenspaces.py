Although one can't predict specific outcomes, it's always highly productive for whatever issue people want to attend to. Some of the inspiring side effects that are regularly noted are laughter, hard work which feels like play, surprising results and fascinating new questions. \\n-Michael M Pannwitz, Open Space practitioner"

Know about their domains of expertise, tell them about yours and if the interests meet up, collaborate for any future projects/prospects. Open Spaces are exactly for providing such environment for you. So go ahead, find a place, interact with people and make the best of this conference. Have a great time!"
