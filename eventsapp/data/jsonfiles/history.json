    "about":"PyCon India started in 2009 as a result of efforts by Noufal Ibrahim and a team of dedicated volunteers. In order to create an umbrella society for managing funds for PyCon India, the late Kenneth Gonsalves registered Indian Python Software Society (IPSS) in 2010 in Ooty, Tamilnadu. After the sad demise of Kenneth in August 2012, there was nobody to manage the affairs of IPSS in Ooty. In order to create an organization which could continue to be the centre of organizing affairs of PyCon India and related efforts, it was decided in an SGM of IPSS to register a new organization for the same in Bangalore, since most of the organizing members of PyCon India were based in Bangalore at that time. Thus, PSSI was registered in Bangalore in 2013 as the new society for managing affairs related to PyCon India.",
